# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was built for boot camp students who were going through the Prework and it contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The process of building this webpage gave me a hands-on introduction to those four topics and how they will play a role in the rest of the boot camp, as well as in my career as a developer.
